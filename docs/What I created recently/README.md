# Hello there!

The repositories/projects I am working on recently are as follows:

- [ZunaTW](https://zuna.tw/)

    This project was built by me and a friend. It is an anonymous dormitory review platform which aims to assist students in National Taipei University (our alma mater) to get more information about the neighboring dormitories. It has collected 200+ organic user reviews.
    
    I implemented the back end with Rails API and previously deployed on Heroku. Since its free tier has ended, and I couldn't find a proper way to pg_restore on Flyio, I decided to deploy it on a Linode instance using Capistrano (as a practice as well).

    I recently set up a blog where I can put my study notes. I spent some time importing old notes created months ago.

- [CoffeeHouse](https://github.com/harryuan65/CoffeeHouse)

    I created this repo half a year ago just to try out Turbo Stream in Rails 7. I recently added stripe integration to it.


- [To-do-Lists](https://github.com/harryuan65/To-do-Lists)

    [React example](https://harryuan65.github.io/to-do-list-react/)

    I want to practice and try out technologies by creating the same a to-do list. It currently has rails, express for backend, and react for frontend.
