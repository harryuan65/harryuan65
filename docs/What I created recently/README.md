Hello there!
The repositories/projects I am working on recently are as follows:

- [ZunaTW](https://zuna.tw/)
    
    This project was built by me and a friend. It is an anonymous dormitory review platform which aims to assist students to get more information about the neighboring dormitories. It has collected 200+ organic user reviews.

- [Blog](https://haoworld.dev)

    I recently set up a blog where I can put my study notes. I spent some time importing old notes created months ago.

- [CoffeeHouse](https://github.com/harryuan65/CoffeeHouse)

    I created this repo half a year ago just to try out Turbo Stream in Rails 7. I recently added stripe integration to it.

- [To-do-Lists](https://github.com/harryuan65/To-do-Lists)

    I was practicing with a to-do list and thought maybe I can learn more technologies by doing this. All implementations should follow the same specification in this repo. It currently has rails, express for backend, and react for frontend.
